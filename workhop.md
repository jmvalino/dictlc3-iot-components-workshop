Using the knowledge we acquired in the webinar let's identify what components we will use in the project.

Since we are dealing with browser-based application, it wall fall to the "Web Application Component" - this will be composed of HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript( Sure enough, we can use JS framewoks as well, but for simplicity, lets go Vanilla !).
